# Robotic Nurse: Autonomous Guidance Vehicle (AGV) for Hospital Assistance

This repository houses the innovative project I had the privilege to contribute to at Fluxing Engineering. We designed and built a driverless robotic nurse for COVID-19 patients. The principal objective was to minimize human interaction in healthcare facilities while ensuring the patients' needs are met effectively.

## :gear: What's Inside?

The project followed a structured process:

1. **Feasibility Analysis** - We conducted comprehensive market research and cost analysis, considering various factors.
2. **Prototype Design** - Our team developed a functional prototype of the robotic nurse.
3. **Hardware Assembly** - We handpicked the hardware components, ensuring compatibility and effectiveness.
4. **Software Integration** - The chosen hardware was fused with a well-structured software that adhered to the customer's specifications.
5. **Microcontroller Programming** - We utilized the FRDM-KL25Z microcontroller to control the AGV and enabled it to receive and send information through a website.
6. **Website Development** - In addition to the robotic nurse, we also developed a website to control and monitor the device.
7. **Testing and Refinement** - Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the robot.

## :computer: Technologies Used

The following technologies were employed in this project:

- C/C++ for microcontroller programming
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for website development
- FRDM-KL25Z Microcontroller
- ESP8266 WiFi Module
- MPU-6000 IMU

## 📝 Final Report 

A detailed report documenting the whole process from the initial feasibility study to the final testing phase is presented in a PDF file (`FinalReport.pdf`). The LaTeX source code for the report is available in the file `FinalReport.tex`.

The report encompasses all the stages of the project and is enriched with various visual aids to provide a clear understanding of our work.

Additional files used in the LaTeX report include:
- `bibliography.bib`: Bibliographic data in BibTeX format.
- Various auxiliary files generated during the LaTeX compiling process.

To recompile the report after making changes, use the command `pdflatex FinalReport.tex` in your terminal.
